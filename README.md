## üöÄ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ common/

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Common components or reusable components can be placed in the `src/components/common/`, for the ui from library like `shadcn` can be placed in `src/components/ui/` directory, and also you can name the directory as a feature like `src/components/register-step/` and place all related components inside it.

The layouts can be placed in the `src/layouts/` directory.

The utility function can be placed in the `src/lib/` directory.

The middlewares can be placed in the `src/middlewares/` directory.

The styles can be placed in the `src/styles/` directory. but we using `tailwindcss` so it could be have just only one global css file.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
